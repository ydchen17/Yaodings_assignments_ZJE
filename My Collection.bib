@article{Black1995,
abstract = {It has been argued that women must be screened and treatment begun for osteoporosis at menopause, since there is an irreversible and substantial loss of bone in the 10 years following menopause. Screening and treatment of women after age 65 has been understudied, since it has been assumed that bone loss in elderly women is slow and treatment would be ineffective if initiated At that time. A number of recent results now suggest that the value of screening elderly women should be reassessed. First, several large studies have demonstrated that we can identify elderly women at high risk of future hip and other fractures using bone mass, particularly bone mass at the hip, as well as other risk factors. Second, it has been shown in recent longitudinal studies that bone loss not only continues but accelerates in old age. Third, a continuing strong association of bone mass with fracture risk, even after age 80, suggests that therapies that slow bone loss will reduce fracture risk in this age group. Lastly, there is a slowly growing body of direct evidence that therapy can reduce fracture risk in the elderly. In addition, findings in a number of studies suggest that there is less necessity to screen and treat at menopause for a number of reasons. First, recent longitudinal results suggest that bone loss at menopause is less accelerated than had been believed and that the accelerated phase is briefer. Second, there is some evidence that elderly women treated with antiresorptive agents experience an increase in bone mass, with the result that an 80-year-old woman who has been treated since menopause has only slightly higher bone mass than an 80-year-old who began treatment at age 65. Lastly, at age ≥65 we can more precisely estimate the risk of hip fracture and therefore target treatment more cost-effectively. We conclude that there is ample justification for screening and treating elderly women. Furthermore, cost-effectiveness analyses that compare early and late screening and treatment options, as well as combinations of the two, must be performed in order to develop an optimal screening and treatment algorithm for osteoporosis.},

@article{Bolton2016,
abstract = {The release of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study in 2002 was a shock to the medical community. Hormone therapy (HT) had generally been considered to be highly beneficial for postmenopausal women since it was the gold standard for relief of menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal atrophy) and it was thought to protect women from osteoporosis, heart disease, and cognitive decline and to generally improve quality of life. However, WHI showed a statistically significant increase in a number of disease states, including breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. One problem with the WHI study was that the average age of women in the study was 63, which is considerably older than the age at which most women enter menopause (about 51). The timing hypothesis attempts to rationalize the effect of age on response to HT and risk of various diseases. The data suggests that younger women (50-60) may be protected from heart disease with only a slight increase in breast cancer risk. In contrast, older women ({\textgreater}65) are more susceptible to breast cancer and heart disease and should avoid HT. This Perspective on Statistical Trends evaluates the current data on HT and risk for chronic diseases as a function of age.},

Outstanding issues not previously addressed include characteristics of breast cancers observed among women using hormones and whether diagnosis may be influenced by hormone effects on mammography.ObjectiveTo determine the relationship among estrogen plus progestin use, breast cancer characteristics, and mammography recommendations.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsFollowing a comprehensive breast cancer risk assessment, 16 608 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with an intact uterus were randomly assigned to receive combined conjugated equine estrogens (0.625 mg/d) plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (2.5 mg/d) or placebo from 1993 to 1998 at 40 clinical centers. Screening mammography and clinical breast examinations were performed at baseline and yearly thereafter.Main Outcome MeasuresBreast cancer number and characteristics, and frequency of abnormal mammograms by estrogen plus progestin exposure.ResultsIn intent-to-treat analyses, estrogen plus progestin increased total (245 vs 185 cases; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; weighted P{\textless}.001) and invasive (199 vs 150 cases; HR, 1.24; weighted P = .003) breast cancers compared with placebo. The invasive breast cancers diagnosed in the estrogen plus progestin group were similar in histology and grade but were larger (mean [SD], 1.7 cm [1.1] vs 1.5 cm [0.9], respectively; P = .04) and were at more advanced stage (regional/metastatic 25.4{\%} vs 16.0{\%}, respectively; P = .04) compared with those diagnosed in the placebo group. After 1 year, the percentage of women with abnormal mammograms was substantially greater in the estrogen plus progestin group (716 [9.4{\%}] of 7656) compared with placebo group (398 [5.4{\%}] of 7310; P{\textless}.001), a pattern which continued for the study duration.ConclusionsRelatively short-term combined estrogen plus progestin use increases incident breast cancers, which are diagnosed at a more advanced stage compared with placebo use, and also substantially increases the percentage of women with abnormal mammograms. These results suggest estrogen plus progestin may stimulate breast cancer growth and hinder breast cancer diagnosis.},

In the nested case-control study, cases of a disease that occur in a defined cohort are identified and, for each, a specified number of matched controls is selected from among those in the cohort who have not developed the disease by the time of disease occurrence in the case. For many research questions, the nested case-control design potentially offers impressive reductions in costs and efforts of data collection and analysis compared with the full cohort approach, with relatively minor loss in statistical efficiency. The nested case-control design is particularly advantageous for studies of biologic precursors of disease. To advance its prevention research agenda, NIH might be encouraged to maintain a registry of new and existing cohorts, with an inventory of data collected for each; to foster the development of specimen banks; and to serve as a clearinghouse for information about optimal storage conditions for various types of specimens.},

@article{Gambacciani2014,
abstract = {Fracture prevention is one of the public health priorities worldwide. Estrogen deficiency is the major factor in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis, the most common metabolic bone disease. Different effective treatments for osteoporosis are available. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at different doses rapidly normalizes turnover, preserves bone mineral density (BMD) at all skeletal sites, leading to a significant, reduction in vertebral and non-vertebral fractures. Tibolone, a selective tissue estrogenic activity regulator (STEAR), is effective in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, vaginal atrophy and prevention/treatment of osteoporosis with a clinical efficacy similar to that of conventional HRT. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene and bazedoxifene reduce turnover and maintain or increase vertebral and femoral BMD and reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures. The combination of bazedoxifene and conjugated estrogens, defined as tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), is able to reduce climacteric symptoms, reduce bone turnover and preserve BMD. In conclusion, osteoporosis prevention can actually be considered as a major additional benefit in climacteric women who use HRT for treatment of climacteric symptoms. The use of a standard dose of HRT for osteoporosis prevention is based on biology, epidemiology, animal and preclinical data, observational studies and randomized, clinical trials. The antifracture effect of a lower dose HRT or TSEC is supported by the data on BMD and turnover, with compelling scientific evidence.},

abstract = {Abstract Osteoporosis-associated fractures are a major public health problem in the United States. Although clinicians and policy groups have advocated estrogen replacement therapy and other clinical measures to prevent osteoporosis, few studies have assessed whether these measures are being adopted by physicians in practice. The purpose of this study is to evaluate physicians' use of osteoporosis prevention measures and to assess the impact of physician specialty and practice setting on osteoporosis prevention performance. A survey of nearly 300 physicians was carried out in a large metropolitan area. Gynecologists, general internists, and cardiopulmonary specialists were included from one of three practice settings: fee-for-service private practice, full-time academic medicine, or a large health maintenance organization. Most physicians, regardless of clinical specialty or practice setting, report that they advocate exercise and calcium supplementation. Few physicians prescribe estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) for the majority of their postmenopausal patients. Although there are minimal differences among the three types of practice settings examined, ERT varies markedly by clinical specialty. Of the gynecologists surveyed, 37{\%} report prescribing ERT for the majority of their postmenopausal patients to prevent osteoporosis compared to only 7 and 5{\%} of general internists and cardiopulmonary specialists, respectively (?2 = 45.3, p {\textless} 0.0001). Although the efficacy of exercise and calcium supplementation to prevent osteoporotic fractures has not been well established, these measures are commonly advocated by both generalists and subspecialists. Although gynecologists are significantly more likely to prescribe ERT to prevent osteoporosis than the other clinical specialists, in general very few physicians prescribe ERT for most postmenopausal patients. This is despite the documented benefit of ERT in preventing osteoporotic fractures. Reasons are explored for physician reluctance to prescribe ERT.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Millions of women in the United States and across the globe abruptly discontinued postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) after the initial Women's Health Initiative trial publication. Few data describing the effects of HT cessation on hip fracture incidence in the general population are available. We evaluated the impact of HT cessation on hip fracture incidence in a large cohort from the Southern California Kaiser Permanente health management organization. METHODS: In this longitudinal observational study, 80,955 postmenopausal women using HT as of July 2002 were followed up through December 2008. Data on HT use after July 2002, antiosteoporotic medication use, and occurrence of hip fracture were collected from the electronic medical record system. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed in 54,209 women once during the study period using the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan. RESULTS: After 6.5 years of follow-up, age- and race-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models showed that women who discontinued HT were at 55{\%} greater risk of hip fracture compared with those who continued using HT (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95{\%} CI, 1.36-1.77). Hip fracture risk increased as early as 2 years after cessation of HT (hazard ratio, 1.52; 95{\%} CI, 1.26-1.84), and the risk incrementally increased with longer duration of cessation (P for trend {\textless} 0.0001). Longer duration of HT cessation was linearly correlated with lower BMD ($\beta$ estimate [SE]) = -0.13 [0.003] T-score SD unit per year of HT cessation; P {\textless} 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Women who discontinued postmenopausal HT had significantly increased risk of hip fracture and lower BMD compared with women who continued taking HT. The protective association of HT with hip fracture disappeared within 2 years of cessation of HT. These results have public health implications with regard to morbidity and mortality from hip fracture.},

Using a recently validated questionnaire/algorithm (90{\%} specificity and sensitivity) in a population-based random sample, the present cross-sectional, case?control study allowed to determine NP prevalence and describe the principal aspects of NP epidemiology. A total of 10?033 subjects (≥18?years) were screened. After identification of subjects with NP and those without, another questionnaire was submitted to NP patients only for further data collection. Controls were individuals without NP, matched by gender and age to NP patients. Results:? Nasal polyposis prevalence was 2.11{\%} (95{\%} CI 1.83?2.39). NP patients (n?=?212, 45{\%} males) were aged 49.4?±?17.6?years. No gender preponderance was observed, but NP tended to increase with age. Mean duration of nasal symptoms was 22.4?±?15.7?years. Among the 145 patients having already seen a doctor for their symptoms, 77.2{\%} have been referred to a specialist, and 18.6{\%} had a diagnosis of NP. Rhinorrhoea was reported by 39.9{\%} of NP patients, blocked nose by 30.8{\%}, and anosmia by 28.9{\%}. Only 6.9{\%} reported facial discomfort while 24.6{\%} complained about general discomfort.

abstract = {As prior fracture is consistently associated with increased risk of subsequent fracture, subjects with a history of prior fracture represent a high risk group which should be targeted for intervention to reduce future fracture rates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether prior osteoporotic fracture affected treatment patterns among subjects admitted with hip fractures. All hip fracture admissions to two major teaching hospitals of the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, over the 12-month period between July 1997 and June 1998 were identified retrospectively from medical records. Patient demographics, frequency and location of prior fractures, and treatment status on admission were recorded. There were a total of 348 atraumatic hip fracture admissions over this 12-month period. Forty five percent of 251 women and 30{\%} of 97 men with an osteoporotic hip fracture had a known prior fracture, including prior hip fracture in 19{\%} of the women and 8{\%} of the men. Among subjects with prior fractures, only18{\%} of women and 7{\%} of men were on any specific anti-osteoporosis therapy. Even among those with a prior hip fracture, only 21{\%} of women and none of the men were taking optimal appropriate therapy. A high proportion of individuals suffering hip fractures had sustained prior "signal" fractures. Although more subjects with prior fracture received treatment than those without prior fracture, total treatment levels were low, and the majority of high-risk subjects did not receive therapy shown to reduce the risk of further fractures.},

abstract = {ContextDespite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain.ObjectiveTo assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.DesignEstrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial (planned duration, 8.5 years) in which 16608 postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers in 1993-1998.InterventionsParticipants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in 1 tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).Main Outcomes MeasuresThe primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD) (nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death), with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.ResultsOn May 31, 2002, after a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect and the global index statistic supported risks exceeding benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002. Estimated hazard ratios (HRs) (nominal 95{\%} confidence intervals [CIs]) were as follows: CHD, 1.29 (1.02-1.63) with 286 cases; breast cancer, 1.26 (1.00-1.59) with 290 cases; stroke, 1.41 (1.07-1.85) with 212 cases; PE, 2.13 (1.39-3.25) with 101 cases; colorectal cancer, 0.63 (0.43-0.92) with 112 cases; endometrial cancer, 0.83 (0.47-1.47) with 47 cases; hip fracture, 0.66 (0.45-0.98) with 106 cases; and death due to other causes, 0.92 (0.74-1.14) with 331 cases. Corresponding HRs (nominal 95{\%} CIs) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. Absolute excess risks per 10 000 person-years attributable to estrogen plus progestin were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 8 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while absolute risk reductions per 10 000 person-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The absolute excess risk of events included in the global index was 19 per 10 000 person-years.ConclusionsOverall health risks exceeded benefits from use of combined estrogen plus progestin for an average 5.2-year follow-up among healthy postmenopausal US women. All-cause mortality was not affected during the trial. The risk-benefit profile found in this trial is not consistent with the requirements for a viable intervention for primary prevention of chronic diseases, and the results indicate that this regimen should not be initiated or continued for primary prevention of CHD.},

abstract = {Osteoporosis -related to various factors including menopause and aging- is the most common chronic metabolic bone disease, which is characterized by increased bone fragility. Although it is seen in all age groups, gender, and races, it is more common in Caucasians (white race), older people, and women. With an aging population and longer life span, osteoporosis is increasingly becoming a global epidemic. Currently, it has been estimated that more than 200 million people are suffering from osteoporosis. According to recent statistics from the International Osteoporosis Foundation, worldwide, 1 in 3 women over the age of 50 years and 1 in 5 men will experience osteoporotic fractures in their lifetime. Every fracture is a sign of another impending one. Osteoporosis has no clinical manifestations until there is a fracture. Fractures cause important morbidity; in men, in particular, they can cause mortality. Moreover, osteoporosis results in a decreased quality of life, increased disability-adjusted life span, and big financial burden to health insurance systems of countries that are responsible for the care of such patients. With an early diagnosis of this disease before fractures occur and by assessing the bone mineral density and with early treatment, osteoporosis can be prevented. Therefore, increasing awareness among doctors, which, in turn, facilitates increase awareness of the normal populace, will be effective in preventing this epidemic.},

@article{Warren2004,
abstract = {Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a complicated clinical issue that requires an in-depth risk/benefit assessment. The term HRT includes both oestrogen plus progestin therapy (OPT) and oestrogen-only therapy (OT). Much research has been done with the former, but additional research is still needed for the latter. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key risks and benefits in order to assist clinicians and patients confronting this issue. In approaching the vast amount of data on HRT a caveat is in order: many of the issues involved are not black and white. The clinical data are often conflicting and careful analysis is required. Despite the discrepancies between the various HRT studies, there is much to be gleaned from a close examination of the data. The primary risks associated with HRT use are related to breast cancer and cardiovascular health. Recent clinical trial data have pointed to a slight increase in the number of breast cancers among women using HRT compared to placebo. With regard to cardiovascular health, the data have shown an increase in stroke and (VTE) but there is also evidence of a possible cardioprotective effect. The major benefits include relief of menopausal symptoms (including vasomotor instability, sexual dysfunction, mood, fatigue and skin issues) and a decrease in fracture risk.},
