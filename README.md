# Yaoding's assignments at ZJE

Here are some of my own works at ZJE :D

When I started studying at ZJE, it was a brand-new experience. I majored in chemistry, history, and geography in my high school, so I really had no clue regarding how to write a biomedicine essay either in Chinese or in English. So, it took me quite a long time to understand how to write about biomedicine and how to write in English fluently, so hopefully my works could be of some help to anyone sharing similar experiences as mine. 

I am not very engaged in my study in Year 1 and 2. Part of the reason is that Edinburgh University just ignored the two years in [degree classification](https://www.ed.ac.uk/academic-services/students/assessment/degree-classification), so I just somehow don't feel motivated to achieve high marks in the initial two years. Thus, I didn't keep a good record of the two years of study. I have asked my AA maybe in Year 2 whether it is OK to put the materials online and got the answer that there was no rule to disallow doing so. But I have removed some figures that might involve some copyrights issue.

Last thing to note here is that all the works here have been checked by Turnitin. So don't copy from here. Hope these could be helpful. :)
