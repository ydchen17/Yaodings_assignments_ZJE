# Yaoding's assignments at ZJE

Here are some of my own works at ZJE :D

When I started studying at ZJE, it was a brand-new experience. I majored in chemistry, history, and geography in my high school, so I really had no clue regarding how to write a biomedicine essay either in Chinese or in English. So, it took me quite a long time to understand how to write about biomedicine and how to write in English fluently, so hopefully my works could be of some help to anyone sharing similar experiences as mine. 

One thing to note is that all the works here have been submitted to Turnitin. So don't copy from here. Hope these could be really helpful. :)
